# SDSU Enterprise Account
Research and Cyberinfrastructure can invite your GitHub Organization to join the SDSU Enterprise account.
[GitHub Enterprise Cloud](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/overview/about-github-enterprise-cloud#what-are-the-differences-between-github-enterprise-cloud-and-other-plans) grants your organization additional features, including GitHub Actions minutes and more.
This process will grant ownership of your organization to the SDSU Enterprise.
You will maintain ownership of your organization and Research and Cyberinfrastructure will not make any changes or take any actions affecting your organization without your knowledge.

You can request to join the SDSU GitHub Enterprise account by completing the [Research Cyberinfrastructure Consultation form](https://sdsu.service-now.com/sp?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=029639611bb825505764fd1b1e4bcb3a&sysparm_category=29ac153fdbbf4c9024094672399619e9) with the following options:
- Request Type = Other
- Please provide a description of your request = I'd like access to GitHub Enterprise for GitHub Classrooms. My GitHub username is [your-github-username] and my GitHub Organization is [your-org-name-here]
- ![](/images/github/classroom-access-1.png)
- Click 'Request'

After submitting the form, Research and Cyberinfrastructure will send an email via GitHub with an invitation to join the SDSU Enterprise account.
You will need to accept this invitation in order to access the enterprise cloud features.
