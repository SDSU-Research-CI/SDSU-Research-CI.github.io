# Autograder and GitHub Actions Minutes
The [GitHub Classroom autograder](https://docs.github.com/en/education/manage-coursework-with-github-classroom/teach-with-github-classroom/use-autograding) feature uses [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/about-github-actions/understanding-github-actions) which consumes "minutes" to run tests and perform grading.
[GitHub Teacher benefits](https://github.com/education/teachers) may include a monthly allotment of actions minutes per month.

When using the autograder you should estimate your minutes consumption per month.
You should factor in the number of students, the number of assignments, the time in minutes on average each test should take and how often you plan for the tests to run (I.E. every time they commit changes or on a schedule).
Depending on those factors, you may find the free alottment of minutes is not enough for your needs.
If that is the case, you might consider [joining the SDSU Enterprise](/github/faqs/enterprise-account/) to take advantage of additional GitHub Actions minutes.
