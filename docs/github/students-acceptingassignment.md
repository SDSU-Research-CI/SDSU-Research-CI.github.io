# Accepting an Assignment
When you are a student in a GitHub Classroom you must accept an assignment before you can begin working on it.
Once you accept the assignment you will create and get access to a unique GitHub repo based on the template repo.
This documentation assumes that you have created a [GitHub account](/github/students/creating-account) and have downloaded & installed [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

1. Paste the assignment link into your browser
    - You may be prompted to sign in

    - Enter your credentials and click 'Sign in'
1. If this is your first time using GitHub Classroom, you may be prompted to authorize GitHub Classroom

1. You should then see this page or something similar:

    - Click the copy icon next to the URL to copy it

Congratulations! You have accepted your assignment and now have a local copy of it which you can work on in your preferred text editor or IDE.
