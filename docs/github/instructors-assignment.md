# Creating an Assignment
Once your GitHub classroom has been created, you can start creating assignments. GitHub classroom supports both individual and group assignments as well as making the assignments viewable to other students or private between the student and teacher.

Assignment will be based on an existing GitHub repository, so you must create or find a repo to use for an assignment. In this example we will use the GitHub Classroom's [github-starter-course](https://github.com/sandiegostate/github/starter-course/tree/main) which is available on the [sandiegstate](https://github.com/sandiegostate) GitHub Organization.

Follow these steps to create your first assignment:
1. If not already signed in, sign in to [https://classroom.github.com/](https://classroom.github.com/)
1. Click 'Create an assignment'

1. Fill out the form and then click 'Contine'
    - ![](/images/github/classroom8.png)
    - In this example we have chosen an individual assignment, no deadline and private repos so that each student can only see their own work
1. From the following form, click the 'Select a repository' dropdown and paste in 'github-starter-course'

    - ![](/images/github/classroom19.png)

    - Note that you can see the student's progress at a high level with the status pill, in this case it is a red 'Not submitted' status and the commit count is 0

    - ![](/images/github/classroom22.png)
    - Note that the status pill has changed to a green 'Submitted' status and that the commit count is now greater than 0
