# GitHub Organization Permissions
It is generally advisable to avoid changing GitHub's default permissions for your organization.
Students do not need to be added as members of your organization as GitHub Classroom will add them directly to their assignment repositories.
However, GitHub does advise that TA's be added as owners to the organization directly.
