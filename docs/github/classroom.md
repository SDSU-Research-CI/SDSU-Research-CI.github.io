## Getting Started
The GitHub Education team has produced a [getting started video series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIRjfNq867bewk3ZGV6Z7a16YDNRCpK3u) for GitHub Classroom.
This series covers topics from adding a student roster to creating assignments and submitting & grading assignments.

In addition to this series, we have created an [FAQ section](/github/faqs) from the experiences of SDSU instructors.
