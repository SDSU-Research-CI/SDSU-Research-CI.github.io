## Next Steps
Any unlinked users will be shown to you. Those students should [create](https://sdsu-research-ci.github.io/github/students/creating-account) a GitHub account and/or [link their SDSUid](https://sdsu-research-ci.github.io/github/students/creating-account#linking-your-sdsuid) to a Github account.

You can then sync your roster up to the Schedule Adjustment Deadline with the "Sync from Canvas" button.
