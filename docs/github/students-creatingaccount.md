# Creating an Account
Creating a GitHub account is a pre-requisite to completing assignments in GitHub Classrooms.
In addition to being able to complete coursework, a GitHub account is valubale as it allows students to showcase their academic and personal coding knowledge, enhancing their academic and professional opportunities.
For this reason, we highly recommend that students create their GitHub accounts with a personal email address so that they can maintain access to it after they graduate.
If you already have a personal GitHub account, feel free to jump ahead to the section on [Linking your SDSUid](#linking-your-sdsuid).

Follow these steps to create a GitHub account:
1. Navigate to the [Join GitHub](https://github.com/signup) page
    - ![](/images/github/creating-account-1.png)
1. Enter your email
    - Again, we highly recommend creating this account with your personal email so that you can keep it in the future

    - Click 'Continue'
1. Create a strong and unique password
