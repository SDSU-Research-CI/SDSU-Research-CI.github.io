# Research Usage

## Active Research Projects

| Project Name | Researcher | Use |
|:-------------|:-----------|:----|
| TBA | Tingting Tang | Research involves solving parametric SDPs in a compact domain and finding the maximum analytical perturbation set within this domain using tools from PDEs and numerical algebraic geometry. Massive computations are performed using MATLAB and Bertini to demonstrate this method with even low dimensional examples such as 1-D, 2-D and 3-D parametric SDPs. |

| Multimodal Synthetic Data Generation | Stephanie Zarrouk | The JupyterHub GPU cluster aided research on multimodal synthetic data generation using the ImageTextGen (ITG) framework, integrating GANs and transformers. ITG generates unbiased synthetic medical data with correlated image and text data types, facilitating precise and responsible training and validation of data-driven models. |
