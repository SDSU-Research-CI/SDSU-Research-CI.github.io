# Overview
SDSU researchers can leverage the California State University system's research cluster, titled the [Technology Infrastructure for Data Exploration (TIDE)](https://tide.sdsu.edu/).

TIDE provides SDSU researchers with access to research-class CPU & GPU resources and was built with a focus on AI and machine learning.
While AI and machine learning workflows are the focus of the cluster they are not a requirement, meaning that other workloads amenable to containerization are welcome.

TIDE will initially be available for testing and feedback from the [science drivers](https://tide.sdsu.edu/science-drivers/#sdsu) before becoming generally availble to all researchers at SDSU.
For the latest updates, check out the [TIDE timeline](https://tide.sdsu.edu/timeline/).

## Research JupyterHub
SDSU currently offers a research-focused JupyterHub instance that offers much greater resource requests than the [instructional cluster](/instructionalcluster) JupyterHub.
JupyterHub is the latest web-based interactive development environment for notebooks, code, and data. 
Its flexible interface allows users to configure and arrange workflows in data science, scientific computing, computational journalism, and machine learning. 
Languages such as Python, R, and Julia are available along with Pandas, PyTorch, and TensorFlow libraries.

### Getting Access
Users can request access by submitting a [Research Cyberinfrastructure Consultation form](https://sdsu.service-now.com/sp?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=029639611bb825505764fd1b1e4bcb3a&sysparm_category=29ac153fdbbf4c9024094672399619e9) with the Request Type of "Access to Existing Cyberinfrastructure" and sharing a few sentences about how they plan to use the cluster.

Once you have been granted access, you can click the button below and authenticate with your [SDSUid](https://it.sdsu.edu/sdsuid) credentials.

## Batch / Long Running Jobs
In addition to the research-focused JupyterHub, more complex jobs can be created and run as software containers directly on the cluster.
Our [Software Factory](/softwarefactory) is available to assist faculty and researchers with software containerization. 
Requests for batch access to TIDE can be made by submitting the [TIDE Contact Us form](https://tide.sdsu.edu/contact/).

*TIDE is supported by the Research & Cyberinfrastructure group within the IT Division. TIDE is funded by [NSF Award #2346701](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2346701)*
