# Overview

SDSU houses the CSU system's Technology Infrastructure for Data Exploration (TIDE).

TIDE provides SDSU and the larger CSU system with access to research-class CPU & GPU resources and was built with a focus on machine learning and AI.

TIDE will initially be available for testing and feedback from the science drivers before becoming generally availble to researchers at SDSU.

## JupyterHub

JupyterHub is the latest web-based interactive development environment for notebooks, code, and data. Its flexible interface allows users to configure and arrange workflows in data science, scientific computing, computational journalism, and machine learning. Languages such as Python, R, and Julia are available along with Pandas, PyTorch, and TensorFlow libraries.

## Batch / Long Running Jobs

While the primary interface of VERNE is JupyterHub, more complex jobs can be created and run as software containers. Our [Software Factory](/softwarefactory) is available to assist faculty and researchers with software containerization. Requests for consultation can be made by [ServiceNow](https://sdsu.service-now.com/sp).

*VERNE is operated by the Research & Cyberinfrastructure group within the IT Division.*
