# Overview
SDSU researchers can leverage the California State University system's research cluster, titled the [Technology Infrastructure for Data Exploration (TIDE)](https://tide.sdsu.edu/).

TIDE provides SDSU researchers with access to research-class CPU, GPU and storage resources to accelerate research in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML).
While AI and ML workflows are the focus of the cluster, they are not a requirement for access to TIDE.
Any research workflow that can be containerized is welcome to make use of TIDE.

For the latest updates, check out the [TIDE timeline](https://tide.sdsu.edu/timeline/).

## TIDE Technical Documentation
Please visit the [TIDE Docs](https://csu-tide.github.io/) for technical information about the cluster including:
- [Batch Jobs](https://csu-tide.github.io/batch-jobs/)
- [Storage Services](https://csu-tide.github.io/storage-services/)
- [Container Creation](https://csu-tide.github.io/container-creation/)
- [Usage Guidelines](https://csu-tide.github.io/usage-guidelines)

## Research JupyterHub
JupyterHub is the latest web-based interactive development environment for notebooks, code, and data. 
Its flexible interface allows users to configure and arrange workflows in data science, scientific computing, computational journalism, and machine learning. 
Languages such as Python, R, and Julia are available along with Pandas, PyTorch, and TensorFlow libraries.

While TIDE offers a CSU-wide JupyterHub instance for all campuses to use, Research and Cyberinfrastructure offers a SDSU-specific research JupyterHub instance.
This research JupyterHub runs on the TIDE cluster and offers much greater resource requests than the [instructional cluster](/instructionalcluster) JupyterHub and is more tailored to SDSU researcher's needs.

### Getting Access
Users can request access to the SDSU research JupyterHub instance by submitting a [Research Cyberinfrastructure Consultation form](https://sdsu.service-now.com/sp?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=029639611bb825505764fd1b1e4bcb3a&sysparm_category=29ac153fdbbf4c9024094672399619e9) with the Request Type of "Access to Existing Cyberinfrastructure" and sharing a few sentences about how they plan to use the cluster.

Once you have been granted access, you can click the button below and authenticate with your [SDSUid](https://it.sdsu.edu/sdsuid) credentials.

## Batch Jobs
In addition to the research-focused JupyterHub, TIDE also supports batch jobs which can be created and run as software containers directly on the cluster.
Our [Software Factory](/softwarefactory) is available to assist SDSU faculty and researchers with software containerization. 

Please see the [TIDE batch jobs documentation](https://csu-tide.github.io/batch-jobs/) for more information and requesting access.

*TIDE is supported by the Research & Cyberinfrastructure group within the IT Division. TIDE is funded by [NSF Award #2346701](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2346701)*
