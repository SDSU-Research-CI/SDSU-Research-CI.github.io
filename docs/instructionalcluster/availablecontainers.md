# Available Containers Images

JupyerHub makes use of a container image to execute your code/commands. You must use a container image that contains the software you wish to use. We use [images](https://ucsd-prp.gitlab.io/userdocs/running/sci-img/) provided by Nautilus which are based on [Jupyter Docker Stacks](https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/selecting.html#core-stacks). However, additional images can be created for specific needs.

All images include GPU Nvidia/CUDA support, and will provide access to GPUs if selected during [container launch](/instructionalcluster/students/launchcontainer).
