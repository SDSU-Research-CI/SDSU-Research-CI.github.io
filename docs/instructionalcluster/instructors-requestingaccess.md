The instructional cluster is in early access mode for the spring 2023 semester.

# Requesting Access

The instructional cluster is available for instructional course use. To request access please submit a [ServiceNow request](https://sdsu.service-now.com/sp) with a subject of "Instructional Cluster Access". Please provide the following details:

- Course / Section
- Approximate number of students
- Details on usage (e.g. introduction to machine learning with Python)
- Which [container image](/instructionalcluster/images) will you use?
- Start/end date of course

Once the request is received, a member of the R&CI team will reach out to coordinate the set up. Individual students are authorized to log in to JupyterHub. The student list will be retrieved from my.SDSU.
