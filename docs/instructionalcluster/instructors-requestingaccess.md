# Requesting Access

The instructional cluster is available for instructional course use. To request access please submit a [ServiceNow request](https://sdsu.service-now.com/sp) with a subject of "Instructional Cluster Access". Please provide your course/section, term, number of students, and details on use cases (e.g. intro to Python). A member of R&CI will reach out to work with you on obtaining access and to ensure the existing software containers meet you needs.
