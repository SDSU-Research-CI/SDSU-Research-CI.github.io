The instructional cluster is in early access mode for the spring 2023 semester.

# Requesting Access

The instructional cluster is available for instructional course use. To request access please submit a <a href="https://sdsu.service-now.com/sp" target="_blank">Service Now request </a> form by using the Form Navigation images below. If the request is course related the following details will be required:

- Course / Class
- Estimated number of students
- Start/end date of course
- Details on usage (e.g. introduction to machine learning with Python)
- Which [container image](/instructionalcluster/images) will you use?


Once the request form is received, a member of the R&CI team will reach out to coordinate the set up. Individual students are authorized to log in to JupyterHub. The student list will be retrieved from my.SDSU.
