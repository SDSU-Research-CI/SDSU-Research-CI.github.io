The instructional cluster is in early access mode for the spring 2023 semester.

# Overview

SDSU's instructional cluster provides undergraduate and graduate students with access to research-class CPU/GPU resources for coursework. Instructors may request access for their courses via ServiceNow. Students will receive access at the start of the semester for the requested course.

The instructional cluster is also available during nonpeak times for specific approved projects. These requests can be made by ServiceNow and will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.

## JupyterHub

JupyterHub is the latest web-based interactive development environment for notebooks, code, and data. Its flexible interface allows users to configure and arrange workflows in data science, scientific computing, computational journalism, and machine learning. Languages such as Python, R, and Julia are available along with Pandas, PyTorch, and TensorFlow libraries.

## Batch / Long Running Jobs

While the primary interface to the instructional cluster is JupyterHub, more complex jobs can be created and run as software containers. Our [Software Factory](/softwarefactory) is available to assist faculty and researchers with software containerization. Requests for consultation can be made by [ServiceNow](https://sdsu.service-now.com/sp).

*The instructional cluster is operated by the Research & Cyberinfrastructure group within the IT Division.*
