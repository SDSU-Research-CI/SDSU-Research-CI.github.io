## Previous Classes

| Course | Class | Use | Semester | Instructor |
|:-------|:------|:----|:---------|:-----------|
| COMPE 160 Introduction to Computer Programming | 2085 |  | Fall 2023 | Paolini |
| ASTR 680 Astronomical Techniques | 6297 | Students work in Linux and use the NumPy, SciPy, and Astropy packages in Python to process and analyze astronomical data. | Fall 2023 | Quimby |
| GEOG 582 GIS Programming With Python | 8357 |  | Fall 2023 | Nara |
| MATH 340 Mathematical Programming | 10879 | Students use [**Stack SciPy**](/instructionalcluster/images) to gain experience of using Python to do the following, (i) Learn the 'science' of computer programming. (ii) Learn the 'art' of computer programming. (iii) Represent abstract mathematics as computer code and translate computer code into mathematics. (iv) Visualize and describe data. (v) Learn in what ways modern computing is done. | Fall 2023 | Tang |
| MATH 522 Number Theory | 10424 |  | Fall 2023 | Kirby |
| P H 700A Principle Program Data Structures in Public Health | 3088 |  | Fall 2023 | Valafar |
| COMPE 361 Advanced Programming   | 10991 | Utilizing the [**Stack SciPy**](/instructionalcluster/images) container image on VERNE, students solve EE problems using Matplotlib, NumPy, HDF5, and the IEEE 754 Standard. Additionally, students solve linear equations, perform regression, interpolation, eigendecomposition, numerical quadrature, fast Fourier transforms, and solve ODEs within the container. | Spring 2023 | Paolini |
| ASTR 350 Astronomical Techniques | 13057 | Students use VERNE to gain firsthand experience working with astronomical data in a Linux environment. They write Python code using NumPy, SciPy, and Astropy to process CCD images, measure the positions and brightness of stars, and to analyze these data to derive distances, ages, and Galactic extinction. | Spring 2023 | Quimby |

# Research Usage

## Active Research Projects

| Project Name | Researcher | Use |
|:-------------|:-----------|:----|
| Multimodal Synthetic Data Generation | Stephanie Zarrouk | The JupyterHub GPU cluster is aiding research on multimodal synthetic data generation using the ImageTextGen (ITG) framework, integrating GANs and transformers. ITG generates unbiased synthetic medical data with correlated image and text data types, facilitating precise and responsible training and validation of data-driven models. |
