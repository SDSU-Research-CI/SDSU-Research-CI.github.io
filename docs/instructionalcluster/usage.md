# Class Usage

## Active Classes

| Course | Class | Use | Semester | Instructor |
|:-------|:------|:----|:---------|:-----------|
| COMPE 361 Advanced Programming   | 10991 | Utilizing the [**Stack SciPy**](/instructionalcluster/images) container image on the instructional cluster, students solve EE problems using Matplotlib, NumPy, HDF5, and the IEEE 754 Standard. Additionally, students solve linear equations, perform regression, interpolation, eigendecomposition, numerical quadrature, fast Fourier transforms, and solve ODEs within the container. | Spring 2023 | Paolini |
| ASTR 350 Astronomical Techniques | 13057 | Students use the instructional cluster to gain firsthand experience working with astronomical data in a Linux environment. They write Python code using NumPy, SciPy, and Astropy to process CCD images, measure the positions and brightness of stars, and to analyze these data to derive distances, ages, and Galactic extinction. | Spring 2023 | Quimby |
